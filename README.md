## Getting Started

To get started with LiteRT for Android, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tehreem-here24/LiteRT-for-Android.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd LiteRT-for-Android
   ```

3. **Open the Project in Android Studio**: Launch Android Studio and open the project folder.

4. **Build the Project**: Make sure all dependencies are resolved, and the project builds successfully.

5. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Tehreem-here24/LiteRT-for-Android/releases) section to download the latest release. Follow the instructions provided to execute the necessary files.

## Usage

Once you have set up the project, you can start using the image classification features. Hereâ€™s a simple guide on how to integrate it into your app:

1. **Add Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies in your `build.gradle` file.

2. **Initialize the Model**: Load your LiteRT model in your application class or activity.

3. **Capture or Select an Image**: Use Androidâ€™s camera or gallery functionality to get an image.

4. **Classify the Image**: Pass the image to the model and retrieve the classification results.

5. **Display Results**: Show the classification results in your UI.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to classify an image using LiteRT:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var imageClassifier: ImageClassifier

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        imageClassifier = ImageClassifier(this)

        val imageBitmap = ... // Load your image here
        val result = imageClassifier.classify(imageBitmap)

        // Display the result
        findViewById<TextView>(R.id.resultTextView).text = result
    }
}
```
